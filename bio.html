    <p>
    I'm Jian Wei (J.W.). I like making things. <br>
    Recently I've been particularly interested in making games,
    so I made a <span class="crawler"> game. </span> <br>
    I wanted to make more but then suddenly I had to go back to school and apply for jobs. <br>
    </p>

    <div class = "crawler">
    I tried to build a Turing machine, but I ran out of tape.
    </div>
